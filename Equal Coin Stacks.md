# Equal Coin Stacks

Ham has 20 nickels, 16 dimes, and 4 quarters. Ham places the coins into 4 stacks so that each stack is worth exactly the same amount. Which stack has the least number of coins?

----------------
This question is impossible!

----------------

Impossible $?
Or do you mean ... I'm Possible!

----------------

Hello I'm Possible
I'm $self

----------------

One way to do questions like this is to simplify the question and do an easier version. 

After we do the simple one, we'll come back and do the original.
----------------
Let's simplify the question by dividing everything by 4.

----------------
Our new simplified question becomes:

    20 nickels -> 5 nickels
    16 dimes -> 4 dimes
    4 quarters -> 1 quarter

    Ham has 5 nickels, 4 dimes, and 1 quarter. Ham places the coins into 4 stacks so that each stack is worth exactly the same amount. Which stack has the least number of coins?

----------------

Every stack is worth the same amount
----------------

And we want one of the stacks to have the least number of coins
----------------
That means that smallest stack has to have the quarter in it!
----------------
Good thinking $.
Maybe that's the answer.
Maybe, the smallest stack is just 1 quarter
----------------
1 quarter is 25 cents
That means the other stacks each have to be 25 cents
----------------
Which means the other 2 stacks add up to 50
----------------
But we still have 4 dimes and 5 nickels.
4 dimes + 5 nickels = 65 cents.

This doesnt match with 50 cents.
I think we have to keep trying.

----------------
Maybe the smallest stack is 1 quarter and 1 dime
----------------

Then every stack needs to be 35 cents.
The other 2 stacks will add up to 70 cents.
----------------
After using 1 quarter and 1 dime,
we still have 3 dimes and 5 nickels.

But 3 dimes and 5 nickels only adds up to 55.
55 doesnt equal 70.
----------------
Ugh muffins!
How do we do this question?
----------------
By not giving up
----------------
But $, its impossible.
----------------
Hi im possible.
Im hungry
----------------


Hungry for more math questions?
----------------
No. Hungry for $dumplings
----------------
lets go to $restaurantOwner's $restaurant.

$restaurantOwner has the best $food. And they only cost 30 cents each.

----------------
30 cents is a quarter and a nickel.

Guys, did we try this one yet?
----------------
We tried 1 quarter and we tried 1 quarter and 1 dime.
----------------
We start with 

table {
    nickels dimes quarters
    5 4 1
}

If we use 1 quarter and 1 nickel,
----------------
We will have 4 nickels and 4 dimes left.

----------------
Each stack adds up to 30 which means the 2 remaining stacks (30 + 30) adds up to 60. 

----------------
4 nickels and 4 dimes left.
That adds up to 60!
----------------

Stack 1 = quarter and nickel

----------------
Stack 2 = nickel nickel dime dime
----------------

Stack 3 = nickel nickel dime dime
----------------
Great job everyone.
We did it!

This definitely feels like the correct answer.
----------------
Now that we did the simplifies question, we have to go back to the original question.

    Ham has 20 nickels, 16 dimes, and 4 quarters. Ham places the coins into 4 stacks so that each stack is worth exactly the same amount. Which stack has the least number of coins?
----------------
Is it okay if we go eat $food instead?
----------------
I vote for $food
----------------
And I as well!
----------------
it's settled.
Guys, We are going to go eat $food at $restaurantOwner's $restaurant.

Sammy, Hammy, we will leave the math question for you.

Wonderful!

Dear Reader,

My name is Sammy,
And my name is Hammy,

$speakers are eating $food at $restaurantOwner's $restaurant.
$restaurantOwner is making $food.

Would you like to try their math question?

    Ham has 20 nickels, 16 dimes, and 4 quarters. Ham places the coins into 4 stacks so that each stack is worth exactly the same amount. Which stack has the least number of coins?

Hammy and Sammy believe 100% that you can do it.

Dont worry if you feel stuck. 
In mathematics, Feeling stuck is the first step to feeling unstuck.
