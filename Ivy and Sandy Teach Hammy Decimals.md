# Ivy and Sandy Teach Hammy Decimals

Hi Ivy, Hi 

Can you guys help me with a multiplying decimals question?

Hammy, the first goal is to remove decimals from the denom

----------------
h how do i remove the decimals from the denom?
----------------
You slide to the right.

Take a look at: 

        124 div 0.0002

The 0.0002 has 4 decimal places.
That means we slide 4 times.
----------------

Say it with me $!
----------------
Slide to the right 1!
----------------
Slide to the right 2!
----------------
Slide to the right 3!
----------------
Slide to the right 4!

----------------
h Because you shift the bottom 4 times, does that mean we also shift the top 4 times?
----------------
That's exactly right h

We started with: 

        124 div 0.0002

Afterwards, we end up with:

        1240000 div 2


----------------

We can solve 1240000 div 2 with long division

@demo
----------------

The final answer is 620000
----------------
h
Thank you $$.
I think I understand it now.
----------------
No problem h.
----------------
h $others, I have prepared some decimal division homework for you.
----------------

But h, you're the one who needs to practice it.

Hi $$$!

----------------
hi hammy. How are you?
----------------
h hammy needs help
----------------
what's wrong? $ and I will help you
----------------
h I am doing a decimal multiplication question and i keep getting the wrong answer. the question is 

    0.2 * 0.004 * 50
----------------
You can totally do it h. 

the most important thing for questions like this is to put the decimals and extra zeroes into your pocket
----------------
h but hammy doesnt have pockets
----------------
does hammy have a backpack for extra cakes?
----------------
h of course!
----------------
h, put the decimals and extra zeroes into your cake backpack
----------------
bold 0.2 has 1 decimal. 
Put the decimal into the backpack. 0.2 becomes a normal 2.

bold 0.004 has 3 decimals. 
We put all 3 decimals into the backpack. 0.004 becomes just 4.

bold 50 has 1 extra zero. 
Put the extra zero into the backpack. 
----------------
At last, we can multiply everything together.
----------------
h 2 times 4 times 5 equals 40
----------------
good job h. now take everything out of your backpack and put it back onto the number
----------------
h even h's cakes? 
----------------
not your yummy cakes.
just the decimals and the extra zeroes

----------------
There was 1 extra zero.
Put it onto the 40. 
----------------
h The 40 becomes 400
----------------
There were 4 extra decimals.
That means we are going to shift 400 left by 4 times.

shift(400, -4, answer=1)
----------------
And that's all you have to do h.

Sometimes the question will have bigger numbers.
----------------
Sometimes the question will be a word problem.
----------------
But the way you do it is always the same.
----------------
h
Thank you $$$,
h understands it now.
----------------

----------------
h $$, I have prepared some decimal homework for you.
----------------

----------------

But h, youre the one who needs to practice it.
