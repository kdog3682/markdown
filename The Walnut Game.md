# The Walnut Game

Hi $, do you want to play the walnut game with me?

----------------
Oh boy, the walnut game. 
That's my favorite game!
----------------
Have you played it before?
----------------
Nope!
----------------

Here is how we play.

First, I start with 17 walnuts.
----------------
How many walnuts do I get?
----------------
You start with 0 walnuts.
----------------
Me want walnuts!
----------------
That's the goal of the game.
The goal is transfer all of my 17 walnuts to you.

----------------
Can I just take your walnuts?
----------------
You can take them, but only 5 at a time.
----------------
Here's what I'll do $.

Round 1: Take 5
Round 2: Take 5
Round 3: Take 5
Round 4: Take 2

Now I'll have all 17 of your walnuts and I'll make walnut pie!
----------------
That won't work $.
You have to always take them 5 at a time. You can't just take 2.

----------------

Let me explain the second rule.

The second rule is you can give walnuts.

----------------
Give walnuts?
----------------
Yes. Instead of taking 5 walnuts, you can also choose to give back 3 walnuts.
----------------

Does that mean I can do something like this?

Round 1: Take 5
Round 2: Give 3
Round 3: Take 5
Round 4: Give 3
----------------
Definitely. If you do that, you'll have 5 - 3 + 5 - 3 = 4 walnuts.
----------------
And the goal is to get 17 walnuts right?
----------------
Right
----------------
Humzles. Let me try this.

Round 1: Take 5
Round 2: Give 3
Round 3: Take 5
Round 4: Give 3
Round 5: Take 5
Round 6: Take 5
Round 7: Give 3
Round 8: Take 5

5 - 3 + 5 - 3 + 5 + 5 - 3 + 5

$, I'm so close. I'm at 16. 
But I don't know how to get 17.

----------------
You can do it $
I know you can
----------------

Humzles. Let me try this.

Round 3: Take 5
Round 4: Give 3

I'm at 4 walnuts.

Round 7: Take 5
Round 8: Give 3

Round 11: Take 5
Round 12: Give 3

Now I'm at 12 walnuts.
