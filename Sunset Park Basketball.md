# Sunset Park Basketball

The games here are gentle
There is a feeling of aggregation
There is a feeling of comraderie
There are repeated encounters and familiarity
There is a wide range of ages
There is a wide range of personalities
There are instances of maturity

It is special
dont know why
maybe it is the feeling of familiarity
there is a feeling that everyone can window
